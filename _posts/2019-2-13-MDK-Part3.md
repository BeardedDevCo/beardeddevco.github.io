Finally I hear you cry we are going to build our application, the coders amongst you must have been chomping at the bit, well you need to reign that in!! There isnt a lot of coding here, well at least not at the base level we are looking at in this series, I will delve deeper in future posts. Fire up webIDE and select "Create New Project from Template" for the purposes of this project (Basically because I cant be bothered setting up destinations) we will choose "Mobile Development Kit Empty Template Application" this will give us our folder structure but not a lot else.

Its probably worth taking a few minutes here to have a look around the structure and the core files particularly "Application.app" as thats where everything hangs together. If you look at Main.page you will see the old drag and drop layout editor you can also open these pages in the code editor and see that they are just JSON files underneath it all.

Lets change the Header on this page and add some static inputs. We can then pass information between the pages with navigation actions.
