Its been a long time coming, anyone who knows me knows I have been talking about making the jump in to contracting for years, I kept putting it off not having faith in my own skills. 

So with the other half going self employed last year ([Naasto Baasto](https://naastobaasto.co.uk)) I decided that what our lives really needed was even less security and made the jump too. I had taken a long absence from work last year after finally facing some mental health demons that I had been ignoring for a few years. I couldn't come back from that in to the same environment I was in and so I found myself handing my notice in over christmas and starting 2019 unemployed. 

Luckily Monica had some work for me, I worked as a potwash through university and forgot how much I missed being in the kitchen, your partner as your boss is bloody hard work though. I lasted a grand total of 1 week before I managed to secure a role through a direct connection I had made last year. 

So far its been great, I am working in technologies that are new to me, I have booked time in for a number of conferences this year and I am looking forward to taking a slightly tighter grip on my own destiny. 

Keep safe people and make time for yourselves.
