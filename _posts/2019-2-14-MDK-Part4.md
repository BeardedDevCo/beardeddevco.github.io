author: Sean Campbell

Now we have looked at how business users might use this tool to build applications quickly and easily lets delve under the sheets a little and look at how developers might use this product. 

Of course for us this means a couple of things, the fredom to get away from webIDE and develop in other editors and the ability to debug our code. Luckily if your chosen editor is VSCode, and why wouldnt it be, possibly the best product microsoft have ever created (Sort Of), then SAP have already been thinking about you and have produced an excellent plugin that brings all the snippets and functionality from webIDE on to your desktop. 

So lets fire up VS Code and get straight in to the installation, <pre>ctrl,shft + p</pre> will have the toolbar open and from here you can search for "Add Extension" once in the extension browser there are a couple of things you will want to install. 

- The Native Script Plugin
- The MDK Plugin

Make sure you have the latest version of the MDK plugin this is 1.4 at the time of writing this. This adds the ability to debug applications that are deployed to mobile services.
