title: MDK - The Client (Part 2)
author: Sean Campbell
---

To test your apps locally you are going to want to set yourself up an MDK client, currently only iOS is supported in the public version of the client although MDK3 and the Android client are fast approaching release.

First thing we are going to do is make a note of some important details from the Mobile Services Cockpit where we first created the app in part one. From your apps page make a note of the following.  

- App Id 
- Server Endpoint from the API's Tab  

From the Security >> oAuth tab you will need to make a note of the following

- Redirect URL
- Authorization End Point
- Token End Point
