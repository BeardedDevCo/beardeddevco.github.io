### Whats Changed

So last year the stress of working in consultancy finally got to me. I woke up one morning and through tears decided I couldnt go on anymore. Im not sure what the flash point was but something broke that day. 

I took 6 months away from Capgemini and consultancy, whilst I was away I was treated amazingly well by my managers and the whole HR team at Capgemini. However I returned beleiving the triggers for my illness would be gone, they were not and I quickly felt myself slipping back and so I decided to go it alone. 

I get to pick my own projects, I can create more time for selfcare, perhaps most importantly of all when my boss is a bit of a dick, well the buck stops here.
